	The Japanese language has a rhythm to it when you speak it; every language does! If you say a series of words like <em>"when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie"</em>, each word takes a certain amount of time to pronounce. Learning to tame the timing of your words in Japanese will make your speaking sound more natural. Luckily, every word follows a fixed set of rules that can be easily broken down into simple units of time– <em>and that's a <strong>mora</strong>!</em>

<h2>What even is a mora?</h2>
<p>
	A <strong>mora</strong> is a unit of time used while pronouncing a word. Some words are made of 1 mora, but all the other ones are <em>made of even mora</em>. Puns aside, each language has their own set of rules for what constitutes as a mora; but all mora are linearly counted. So a word with 2 mora takes twice as long to pronounce as a word with 1 mora; and word with 20 mora would take 20 times the amount of time to pronounce as that same word with 1 mora.
</p>
<p>
	Knowing that, breaking down the language-specific rules for the Japanese mora is even easier! The Japanese mora <em>(モーラ)</em> can be most easily noticed when reading the language through hiragana or katakana text. Each character in those alphabets are actually indicative of 1 mora-- <em>that's it!</em> Pretty cool, right? So モーラ can be broken down in to 3 mora: <code>モ</code>, <code>ー</code>, and <code>ラ</code>.

	<figcaption>Kana is all well and good, but what is a mora if you can't read Japanese?</figcaption>

<h2>But what if I can only read romaji, man? Then what???</h2>
<p>
	For those who can't read the kana alphabets like hiragana & katakana yet, there is another easy way to better understand what a mora is. No need to feel left out and completely confused!
</p>
<p>
	Japanese is often called a syllabary language, and although that is only <em>kind-of</em> true, that concept does give a much easier heuristic to understand the mora. <strong>Consider the mora akin to a Japanese syllable</strong><a href="#note-one">*</a>. So when you are pronouncing <code>konnichiwa</code>, instead of saying it in a very Americana way like <code>ko-ni-chi-wa</code>, you would pronounce it as <code>ko-n-ni- chi-wa</code>, because each of those sound groupings are an individual Japanese syllable<a href="#note-one">*</a>.

<p>
	In this case, you'll get the most bang for your buck if you study the sounds & syllables<a href="#note-one">*</a> of the Japanese language. Knowing this will allow you to better speak in a way that is more attuned with the Japanese rhythm. You'll sound much more natural then!
</p>
<p>Anyways, that's it. <em>~Peace out</em></p>

        * Japanese "syllables" like <code>n</code> and the vowels are <em>technically</em> not syllables, at least from a western definition; but just go with it for the sake of the heuristic!
