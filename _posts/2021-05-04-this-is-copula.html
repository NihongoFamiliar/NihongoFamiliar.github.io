<p>
	Sorry if that felt a little weird & aggro. All of those questions were actually examples of me using a really common linguistic treasure called <strong>the copula</strong>! Most languages have it, and most will generously use it every day. For our purposes though, let's talk about using it in the Japanese language!
</p>
<br /><br />

<h2>What even is a copula?</h2>
<p>
	So a copula is a word you use in a sentence that has the intense executive power to deem one thing as equal to another. In English, "is" is our copula. You can even see it used as such in that very sentence!
</p>
<p>
	We also say other things like "this thing <strong>is</strong> that quality or idea", and "That guy from Math class, I think his name <strong>is</strong> Micheal<a href="#sorry-micheals">*</a>– He <strong>is</strong> a total tool". That copula is a shortcut to the very long and wordy route a language might otherwise take to say "Concerning that not-so-gentlemanly person from our arithmetic scholarly gathering, I have a rough approximation that his name may equivocate to Micheal<a href="#sorry-micheals">*</a>; Anyway, I think that this person has the qualities that make him comparable to a rube-ish automaton".
</p>
<p>
	Unless you want to sound like some kind of tool (much like Micheal<a href="#sorry-micheals">*</a> is), using a copula usually helps make your peers hate you less.
</p>

	<figcaption>This IS my fist, Micheal!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	In the Japanese language, the copula comes in many forms! We can talk about those another time though. For now, we are going to focus on only one: <code>です</code>, or <code>desu</code> for those who can't read Japanese yet.
</p>
<p>
	です is how you would say "is" in English. It <em>is</em> a verb, it <em>is</em> present-tense, and it <strong>is</strong> 🔥🔥🔥!
</p>

<h2>How to copulate</h2>

<p>In order to use です in Japanese, we gotta learn a little bit about syntax! That is a fancy linguistic term for the word-order of a sentence. A basic Japanese sentence flows like this:</p>

<pre><code>Subject Object Verb</code></pre>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>subject</strong> does a thing. It actions, and it verbs.</li>
	<li>The <strong>object</strong> is what the subject is doing something to or at.</li>
	<li>The <strong>verb</strong> is the action~ It is what the subject does, and possibly to an object!</li>
</ul>

	<img src="/assets/post-6_img-2.png" alt="'This IS (not) a cookie', homage to René Magritte's The Treachery of Images, but emphasizing the copula too." />
</figure>

<p>
	An example would be something like <code>これ</code> は <code>クッキー</code> <code>です</code>, and in romaji for those who can't read Japanese yet: <code>kore</code> wa <code>kukkii</code> <code>desu</code>. Each section of the sentence is highlighted appropriately to show the subject, an object, and then a verb. Notice that です, our copular verb, is at the end of the sentence!
</p>
<p>
	In English, as a comparison, we have a syntax of <code>Subject Verb Object</code>. Our example sentence would be translated to <code>This</code> <code>is</code> a <code>cookie</code>.
</p>

<h2>Super duper practice time!</h2>
<p>
	So now that you know about the copula です & how to use it, let's stretch those learning muscles and give it a try! Here are some vocabulary items to try making a Japanese sentence with the copula. Personally, I find the most gratifying kind of practice for this to be pointing at things and shouting in utter shock <code>これは＿＿＿です！</code>
</p>

<h2>Some vocab to try out:</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>This</dt>
	<dd>
        <span lang=”ja” title=”kore”>これ</span> (kore)
    </dd>

	<dt>That</dt>
	<dd>
        <span lang=”ja” title=”sore”>それ</span> (sore)
    </dd>

	<dt>That (but further away)</dt>
	<dd>
        <span lang=”ja” title=”are”>あれ</span> (are)
    </dd>

	<dt>Food</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”たべもの, tabemono”>
            食べ物
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>たべもの</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (tabemono)
    </dd>

	<dt>Drink</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”のみもの, nomimono”>
            飲み物
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>のみもの</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (nomimono)
    </dd>

	<dt>Animal</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”どうぶつ, doubutsu”>
            動物
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>どうぶつ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (doubutsu)
    </dd>

	<dt>Plant</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”しょくぶつ, shokubutsu”>
            植物
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>しょくぶつ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (shokubutsu)
    </dd>

	<dt>Furniture</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”かぐ, kagu”>
            家具
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>かぐ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (kagu)
    </dd>
</dl>



<h2>Extra Credit!</h2>
<p>
	If you want to make question about what something is, it can be as easy as putting <code>か</code> (or <code>ka</code>) after the <code>です</code> at the end of the sentence. It basically acts as a verbal question mark (?), but we will talk about that in a different post.
</p>
<p>Here are some question words in the meantime to play with:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>What</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”なん (or なに), nan (or nani)”>
            何
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>なん or なに</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (nan or nani)
    </dd>

	<dt>Who</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”だれ, dare”>
            誰
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>だれ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (dare)
    </dd>

	<dt>Where</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”どこ, doko”>
            何処
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>どこ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (doko)
    </dd>

	<dt>When</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”いつ, itsu”>
            何時
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>いつ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (itsu)
    </dd>

	<dt>Why/How</dt>
	<dd>
        <ruby lang=”ja” title=”なぜ, naze”>
            何故
            <rp> (</rp>
            <rt>なぜ</rt>
            <rp>)</rp>
        </ruby> (naze)
