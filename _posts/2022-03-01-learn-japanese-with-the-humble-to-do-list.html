	I wanted to start making more insights this year about little projects you can do at home to practice your Japanese. So without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to the first one of these: The To-do List &#10004;&#10004;&#10004;!

<h2>How a to-do list can help you learn Japanese:</h2>
<p>
	You’re probably thinking to yourself <em>"I already have to find time to study and do all my other life-things— but now I have to add making literal to-do lists to my figurative to-do list???".</em> I hear you. It never ends, right? But hear me out~
</p>
<p>
	To-do lists are not only an incredible tool for organizing your personal hot mess of a life into less-daunting, bite-sized pieces— they are also an opportunity to practice learning Japanese in small, organized, and very personalized ways!
</p>
<p>
	The best part of using a to-do list to learn Japanese, however, is being able to check off each goal. It is a satisfying and very concrete moment of validation that you have made one step of progress in your language learning adventure! It definitively shows you proof of your own progress as you are making it~

<h3>Organize your learning goals & resources</h3>
<p>
	A simple way a to-do list can help your Japanese language learning quest is to organize your learning goals. This is the most basic way you can use a to-do list. Creating a structure for keeping track of your progress and the resources used to make it happen. Things like:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A list of <strong>topics</strong> you want to learn or practice.</li>
	<li>A list of what you want to <strong>do</strong> in order to practice or learn.</li>
	<li>A list of <strong>resources</strong> (books, blogs, etc.) you can use or want to review.</li>
</ul>

<h3>An additional way to practice your Japanese</h3>
<p>There is an additional, super duper secret-not-secret method for using a to-do list to learn Japanese:</p>
<blockquote>
	<strong><em>Write your to-do list in Japanese.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
	That's it. This method provides a great practice opportunity for both reading and writing the language! Depending on how complicated your list is, you can use Japanese vocabulary,  simple sentences, and even apply separation by category.
</p>
<p>
	If you're already a fan of to-do lists, then this just means a slight adjustment to remember to write in Japanese. If you're not much of a to-do-er, then you might want to try this method after you've gotten used to using to-do lists.
