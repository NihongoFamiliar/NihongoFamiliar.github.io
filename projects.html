<p>
	In my never-ending quest to learn the Japanese language, I've wanted to bring a little magic &amp; wonder to the learning experience so that I, &amp; people who share this journey, can be eager to continue the learning adventure with a renewable sense of excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>
	Check out these baller AF projects I am working on to help learn &amp; study Japanese:
</strong></p>

<h2>Sites &amp; Apps</h2>
<h3>Kana-gories!</h3>
<p>
	<em>Kana-gories!</em> is a mini-game where you can practice Japanese vocabulary by being given prompts that start with specific kana or letters. You can play multiple rounds with your friends &amp; learn from each other as you play.
</p>
<p><strong>This is most useful for you if:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You are at an intermediate or advanced level of Japanese.<br />
		<small><em>(There are later plans to update this to support beginners)</em></small>
	</li>
	<li>Playing with in-person groups or through a streaming service.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Right now, this project is in a simplified form. There are plans to update it to support different learning levels, as well as support better accessibility for people who use assistive technologies. Keep an eye out for updates!
